Machine Learning Pipeline
Welcome to the Machine Learning Pipeline repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for implementing a pipeline of machine learning algorithms for various tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering.

Overview
This repository provides a structured approach to building and deploying machine learning models in a pipeline. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking to streamline your workflow, you'll find everything you need to create and manage a machine learning pipeline here.

Pipeline Components
1. Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning: handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Feature engineering: creating new features, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
2. Model Selection
Exploring different machine learning algorithms: decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, etc.
Hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as grid search or random search.
Model evaluation: cross-validation, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and model selection criteria.
3. Model Training
Training selected machine learning models on the training data.
Monitoring training progress, including loss and performance metrics.
Saving trained models for deployment.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluating trained models on the testing data.
Assessing model performance using various metrics and visualization techniques.
Iterating on model selection and tuning based on evaluation results.
5. Deployment
Deploying the trained model into a production environment.
Integrating the model with other systems or applications.
Monitoring model performance in production and performing updates as needed.
Requirements
Python (3.x recommended)
Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy (for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
